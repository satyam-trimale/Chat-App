## üõ°Ô∏è End-to-End Encryption Details

- **Key Generation:** Each user generates a public/private key pair on signup. The private key is encrypted with the user's password and stored securely.
- **Message Encryption:** Messages are encrypted with a shared secret derived from the sender's private key and the recipient's public key (ECDH + AES-GCM).
- **Zero Knowledge:** The server never sees plaintext messages or unencrypted private keys.
- **Forward Secrecy:** Each user pair has a unique shared secret.
